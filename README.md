# NukeBot - Discord Bot
This is a revenge bot, to be honest. It can ruin the entire server within 1-2 minutes or lesser. This bot can do some basic moderation too.

Bot is completely free to use and edit. So do not worry about anything. Let me know if you found any error in it.

I made this bot for testing my skills. Bot is completely written in `discord.py` module. Do add some other features. I will like that. This bot is made considering that you are very beginner to `discord.py`. So before changing anything do check the documentation.

You can [test my bot](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=825011717284036608&permissions=8&scope=bot) or you can self host it. Consider staring the project. I will feel good. 

The bot will work fine with 1,000-10,000 members, I guess. For any help and support consider asking me out either via my [Email](mailto:ritik0ranjan@gmail.com) or join my [Discord Server](discord.gg/NEyJxM7G7f).

### How?

Best and free way to host this bot is from [repl.it](http://repl.it "repl.it"). First you need to make a bot in [Discord Developer Portal](http://discord.com/developers/). Make a bot there. Grab the bot token. Fire the repl.it. Make a new application clone this repo. Paste the bot token in `.env` file. Run the bot (You can do changes in the code). Then you will get the link somelike like, `https://PROJECT_NAME.REPL_USERNAME.repl.co`. Keep pinging this site (about in every 10-15 mins) with [Uptime Robot](https://uptimerobot.com/). 

I know you have not understood what I mean. So, watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPTfmiYiuok) video tutorial. Thank you Beau Carnes for making this tutorial.
